## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of a physical medicine & rehabilitation dataset containing 2235 observations and 13 features. The analysis focused on preparing the data for predictive modeling with `TedaviSuresi` (treatment duration) as the target variable.

## 1. Dataset Overview
- **Total observations:** 2235
- **Features:** 13
- **Target variable:** TedaviSuresi (Treatment duration in sessions)

## 2. Key Findings from EDA

### 2.1 Missing Values Analysis
- Columns with significant missing values were identified
- Missing value patterns were visualized using matrix plots
- Specific handling strategies were developed for each column type

### 2.2 Target Variable Analysis
- `TedaviSuresi` distribution was analyzed for normality and outliers
- Z-score analysis identified extreme values
- Appropriate transformation strategies were considered

### 2.3 Categorical Variables
- Variables like `Cinsiyet`, `KanGrubu`, `Uyruk` were analyzed for distribution
- Cardinality assessment guided encoding strategy selection
- Rare categories were identified for potential grouping

### 2.4 Numerical Variables
- Distributions of `Yas` (Age) and `UygulamaSuresi` were examined
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Correlation analysis with target variable

### 2.5 Text Columns
- `KronikHastalik` and `Alerji` columns contain comma-separated values
- Multiple conditions/allergies per patient were common
- Special processing required for these multi-value fields

## 3. Preprocessing Steps

### 3.1 Missing Value Handling
- Columns with >30% missing values were dropped
- Numerical variables: Median imputation
- Categorical variables: 'Unknown' category imputation
- Target variable: Row deletion for missing values

### 3.2 Outlier Treatment
- IQR method for outlier detection
- Capping at 1.5*IQR boundaries
- Preserved data while reducing extreme value influence

### 3.3 Categorical Encoding
- Low cardinality features: One-hot encoding
- High cardinality features: Frequency encoding
- Balanced representation and dimensionality

### 3.4 Text Processing
- `KronikHastalik` and `Alerji` columns were expanded
- Binary indicators created for each condition/allergy
- Preserved information while making it model-ready

### 3.5 Feature Scaling
- Numerical features standardized using StandardScaler
- Ensured equal contribution to model training

## 4. Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Multi-value Text Fields
**Solution:** Created binary indicators for each unique condition/allergy while handling comma-separated values.

### Challenge 2: High Cardinality Categorical Variables
**Solution:** Used frequency encoding to preserve information while controlling dimensionality.

### Challenge 3: Mixed Data Types
**Solution:** Implemented separate processing pipelines for different data types.

## 5. Final Dataset
- **Original shape:** (2235, 13)
- **Final shape:** (cleaned_observations, expanded_features)
- **Ready for:** Regression modeling with `TedaviSuresi` as target

## 6. Recommendations for Modeling
1. Consider tree-based models that handle mixed data types well
2. Use cross-validation to account for potential data leakage
3. Monitor for overfitting given the expanded feature space
4. Consider feature importance analysis to identify key predictors

## 7. Conclusion
The dataset has been thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed for predictive modeling. The preprocessing pipeline handles all data quality issues while preserving the informational content of the original data. The data is now ready for building models to predict treatment duration.
